Pandas has a variety of methods for [styling notebooks](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/style.html). I have been using those methods in the [model_inspector](https://gsganden.github.io/model_inspector) library to display [correlation matrices](https://gsganden.github.io/model_inspector/explore.html#show_correlation) and [confusion matrices](https://gsganden.github.io/model_inspector/tune.html#confusion_matrix) in Jupyter notebooks with appropriate highlighting.

Note that it uses a diverging colormap so that positive values are red and negative values are blue. I often see sequential colormaps used here, which make it hard to distinguish between positive, negative, and near-zero values.](correlation_matrix.png)

I recently encountered a problem with this approach: DataFrames were not rendering with custom styling when I reopened a notebook after saving it. After an hour or two of fruitless Googling, I figured out why: the notebook was not trusted, so Jupyter was not running the code to do the custom rendering when I reopened it. Running the Terminal command `jupyter trust my_notebook.ipynb` fixed the problem.
