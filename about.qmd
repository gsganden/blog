I am a machine learning engineer.

- [Model Inspector](https://gsganden.github.io/model_inspector) (machine learning visualization library)

Previous employers:

- [Cruise](https://www.getcruise.com/) (autonomous vehicles)
- Argo AI (autonomous vehicles)

In a previous life I received a Ph.D. in History and Philosophy of Science and an MA in Statistics, both from the University of Pittsburgh. My academic research addressed questions about the proper use of statistical methods, such as [what to do with the results of an experiment that ends earlier than planned](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00214).
