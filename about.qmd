In a previous life I received a Ph.D. in History and Philosophy of Science and an MA in Statistics, both from the University of Pittsburgh. My academic research addressed questions about the proper use of statistical methods, such as [what to do with the results of an experiment that ends earlier than planned](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00214).
